# Using Python in SDS348

We've imported python code into RMarkdown files, such as this one. We used reticulate to allow R and python to talk to each other in python code chunks. Below is some work from HW assignments.

The following is my solution to the problem: Write a function that takes a string of nucleotides as input and returns a dictionary with all 3-mers present in that string, and the number of times that each 3-mer occurs. Then use your function to find the 3-mers in the DNA sequence my_seq1 defined below.

```{python}
my_seq1 = "ATCATCATG"
my_seq2 = "CAGCCCAATCAGGCTCTACTGCCACTAAACTTACGCAGGATATATTTACGCCGACGTACT"
def count_kmers(read, k):
  counts = {}
  num_kmers = len(read) - k + 1
  for i in range(num_kmers):
    kmer = read[i:i+k]
    if kmer not in counts:
      counts[kmer] = 0
    counts[kmer] += 1
  return counts
print(count_kmers(my_seq1, 3)) 
print(count_kmers(my_seq2, 3))
```

The following is a uses Needleman-Wunsch to align the following two sequences by hand: 1. CCAGT 2. ACAAGT
